"What is recurrent equation of RNN output function ?",""
"What is the minimum and maximum value of tanh ?","-1 <= tanh <=1"
"How many thresholds we need to check for a real valued features in DT ?","We first sort the numerical feature in ascending order then
We check through all n-possible splitting criteria and we choose the one which gives us the maximum information gain.
"
"How do you compute the feature importance in DT ?","The importance of a feature is computed as the (normalized) total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature. It is also known as the Gini importance."
"How do you compute the feature importance in SVM ?","Yes, there is attribute coef_ for SVM classifier but it only works for SVM with linear kernel. For other kernels it is not possible because data are transformed by kernel method to another space, which is not related to input space.
We can't get feature importance and the model is not very interpretable  are especially in Kernel SVM's"
"Prove that L1 will given sparsity in the weight vector ?",""
"What are L1,L2 regularizers ?","L1 Regularizer adds “absolute value of magnitude” of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function.
L2 Regularizer adds “squared magnitude” of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function. 
The key difference between these techniques is that Lasso shrinks the less important feature’s coefficient to zero thus, removing some feature altogether. So, this works well for feature selection in case we have a huge number of features."
"What is elastic net ?","Another alternative for regularizer, it says we have to choose either L1 and L2 regularizer why not both. So Elastic net is combination of both L1 and L2 regularizer and for it we have to tune two hyperparameter separately for both regularizer."
"What are the assumption of NB ?","Assumption in Naïve Bayes is , All features should have conditionally independent."

* Two vectors A and B are perpendicular if and only if their scalar product is equal to zero."
"How dropout works ?","Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. They are “dropped-out” randomly. This means that their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass.
Dropout can be applied to input neurons called the visible layer.
Dropout rate (p) value should be large and NOT small when we are overfitting with many weights and few data points."

"Numbers of tunable parameters in dropout layer ?","Tunable parameter in dropout layer is dropout rate."
"When F1 score will be zero? And why ?","F1 will never be zero, but very near to zero for a bad classifier. If TP or TN is zero then there isn't any need to 
check F1.
F1  as the harmonic mean is defined only at positive real numbers. Precision or Recall could be equal 0 in case TP=0. Which provides to undefined result F1=0/0"
"What is the need of dimensionality reduction.","Dimensionality Reduction helps in data compression, and hence reduced storage space.
It reduces computation time.
It also helps remove redundant features, if any.
Helps to visualize data in low dimension."
"What happens if we do not normalize our dataset before performing classification 
using KNN algorithm.","A numerical value can have different scales. Based on different scales we are going to get the different distances. To make it same for all we need to normalize."
"What is standard normal variate ?","The standard normal distribution is one of the forms of the normal distribution. It occurs when a normal random variable has a mean equal to zero and a standard deviation equal to one.

The random variable of a standard normal distribution is known as the standard score or a z-score. It is possible to transform every normal random variable X into a z score using the following formula:

z = (X – μ) / σ"
"What is the significance of covariance and correlation and in what cases can we not 
use correlation.","Correlation and covariance are very closely related to each other, and yet they differ a lot. Covariance defines the type of interaction, but correlation defines not only the type but also the strength of this relationship. 
Due to this reason, correlation is often termed as the special case of covariance. However, if one must choose between the two, most analysts prefer correlation as it remains unaffected by the changes in dimensions, locations, and scale. Also, since it is limited to a range of -1 to +1, it is useful to draw comparisons between variables across domains. 
However, an important limitation is that both these concepts measure the only linear relationship."
"How do we calculate the distance of a point to a plane.","The shortest distance from a point to a plane is actually the length of the perpendicular dropped from the point to touch the plane.
Distance (d)=W.P/||W|| where W is normal to plane at origin"
"When should we choose PCA over t-sne.","There are many places where we choose PCA over t-SNE
* Stochasticity of final solution:: PCA is deterministic; t-SNE is not. One gets a nice visualisation and then her colleague gets another visualisation.
* Interpretability of mapping.
* Sometime PCA will be useful when we want to retain some percentage of information from data and we can calculate with eigen values."

"How relevant / irrelevant is time based spitting of data in terms of weather
