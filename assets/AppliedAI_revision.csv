What is sampled softmax?
Why is it difficult to train a RNN with SGD?
How do you tackle the problem of exploding gradients? (By gradient clipping)
What is the problem of vanishing gradients? (RNN doesn't tend to remember much things from the past)
How do you tackle the problem of vanishing gradients? (By using LSTM)
Explain the memory cell of a LSTM. (LSTM allows forgetting of data and using long memory when appropriate.)
What type of regularization do one use in LSTM?
"What is the problem with sigmoid during backpropagation? (Very small, between 0.25 and zero.)"
What is transfer learning?
What is backpropagation through time? (BPTT)
What is the difference between LSTM and GRU?
Explain Gradient Clipping.
"Adam and RMSProp adjust the size of gradients based on previously seen gradients. Do they inherently perform gradient clipping? If no, why?"
